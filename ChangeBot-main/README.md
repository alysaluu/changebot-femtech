# Why We Made This App?

Through the years, the active involvement of citizens in politics while holding their politicians accountable for their actions has been a cornerstone of democracy. In today’s society, with political issues such as   
Anti-transgender legislature
Police brutality 
And Asian hate crimes 
on the rise, there is a great need for a tool that amplifies people’s voices to demand change and political accountability from representatives. 

We want people to feel politically well-informed and empowered, and we think Kratos, which is Greek for “power,” will help them do so.
